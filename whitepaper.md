# ASTROLABE
## Navigating the Universe of Formal Mathematics

**Whitepaper v1.0**
January 2026

## Abstract

Mathematics is the language of the universe. For centuries, it has been the privilege of the few. We believe it should belong to everyone.

**Astrolabe** is an open-source, AI-native interface framework for formal mathematics. Together with **OpenMath**, we are building infrastructure to accelerate the fusion of AI and mathematics — transforming mathematical knowledge into a universally accessible resource.

We are not just building tools. We are exploring a new paradigm for mathematical research: one where humans use AI to amplify their creativity, to explore freely, and to accelerate discovery. Contributions are transparently rewarded. The barriers between professional mathematicians and curious minds dissolve.

Through the OpenMath ecosystem, both **interface contributors** — the developers, designers, and AI engineers who build better ways to interact with formal mathematics — and **proof contributors** — the mathematicians, students, and researchers who advance human knowledge — are transparently rewarded for their work.

The future of mathematics is formal. The future of mathematics is open. The future of mathematics is for everyone.

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Turning Point

We are at a turning point in the history of mathematics.

**AI is lowering the barrier to formal mathematics.** What once required months of learning formal proof languages can now be assisted by AI. Mathematicians no longer need to master Lean or Coq to participate — AI can help translate their ideas into verified proofs.

This opens unprecedented possibilities:
- **Pure mathematicians** can engage with formal verification without becoming programmers
- **Cross-disciplinary researchers** — physicists, economists, computer scientists — can formalize results in their fields
- **Students and curious minds** can explore and contribute to the frontier of mathematical knowledge

AI is making formal mathematics accessible. But the infrastructure has not caught up.

### The Interface Problem

Mathematical activity itself is changing. We need new ways to interact with it.

Existing tools were designed for the old paradigm: mathematicians writing proofs alone, in text, with static dependency graphs. They have served us well, but the age of AI-assisted mathematics demands something new.

We need:
- **More creative visual interfaces** — not just text, but dynamic, explorable representations of mathematical structures
- **New interaction patterns** — ways to collaborate with AI, to visualize dependencies in real-time, to navigate vast proof libraries intuitively
- **A space where everyone's insights matter** — not just professional mathematicians

Here is the opportunity: **AI-assisted programming and advancing AI hardware have democratized software creation.** You no longer need to be a professional developer to build interfaces. Anyone with a creative idea for how humans should interact with formal mathematics can now bring that idea to life.

We need everyone's inspiration. Astrolabe is the framework to make it happen.

### The Incentive Problem

Formal proofs are **perfect for blockchain storage** — they are deterministic, verifiable, and immutable. Yet there is no infrastructure to:
- Store and verify proofs on-chain
- Distribute rewards to AI mathematicians and human contributors
- Create transparent attribution for mathematical work

### The Paradigm Shift

Under the acceleration of AI, mathematics is changing. We need:
- **A new system for recording scientific contributions** — one that captures the collaborative, iterative nature of AI-assisted research
- **A new incentive structure** — one that rewards both the humans who guide AI and the community that builds better tools
- **A new research paradigm** — open, decentralized, and accessible to all

This is what Astrolabe and OpenMath are building together.

## 2. Solution

### Astrolabe: An Open Framework for Exploration

Astrolabe is not a finished product — it is an open-source framework inviting the community to explore and build together.

Astrolabe provides the foundation: 3D visualization of formal mathematics, automatic parsing of Lean projects, flexible node creation and annotation, and tools that work seamlessly with AI coding assistants.

But this is just the beginning. We are building toward a future where Astrolabe integrates with OpenMath's proof marketplace, supports multiple formal languages, and becomes the window through which anyone can explore the universe of verified mathematics.

### The Invitation

Astrolabe is a starting point, not an endpoint. We are searching for the best interaction patterns for AI-assisted mathematics — and we need your creativity.

In the future, AI + formal mathematics belongs to everyone. Not just mathematicians. Not just developers. **Everyone.**

Whether you are a mathematician with ideas about how proofs should be visualized, a designer imagining new interfaces, a student curious about the frontier of knowledge, or simply someone with a vision for how humans and AI should collaborate — Astrolabe is your canvas.

**Join us in shaping the future of mathematics.**

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Astrolabe** | User acquisition, visualization, AI interaction |
| **OpenMath** | Proof marketplace, bounty management, reward distribution |
| **Shentu Chain** | On-chain verification, immutable storage, token transactions |

---

## 4. Tokenomics

### The OpenMath Ecosystem

Astrolabe connects to the **OpenMath ecosystem**, which uses **CTK** (Shentu Chain's native token) to reward contributions to formal mathematics.

OpenMath implements a Gas-based incentive mechanism that encourages mathematical elegance — simpler, more elegant proofs earn higher rewards. For details on proof bounties and reward mechanisms, see OpenMath's documentation.

### Astrolabe Contributors

Astrolabe is open-source. Early contributors who help build the interface layer — developers, designers, AI engineers — will receive token allocation based on GitHub contribution history.

> **Note**: Specific allocation to be determined in coordination with OpenMath.
